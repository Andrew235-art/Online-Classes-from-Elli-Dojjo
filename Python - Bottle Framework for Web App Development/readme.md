# Python - Bottle Framework for Web App Development


## Video - https://youtu.be/-SD7L4H6gBA


## Description

This class will teach you how to use the Bottle Framework to build Web Apps with Python. Bottle is a great framework for its simplicity and ease of use. Simply by running the script the web app becomes functional, and you can learn how to build web apps in a very short time.

We will be using the Bottle framework a great deal for our classes so that students can easily build interactive systems to start to really see the value of Python for solving problems.

As a "micro framework" Bottle lacks functionality other frameworks such as Django has, but if you're looking to spin up Python projects where you would like simple HTML inputs and outputs with Bottle you can have something up and running in minutes.
