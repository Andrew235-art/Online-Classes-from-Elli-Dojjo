You can create a script to scrape and extract value from your own data, use AI to to make it more natural to "talk" with your systems, and build services with your own guard rails for your users.

OpenAI provides amazing functionality to make your scripts and systems do some very remarkable things. It's not actually "AI", but it's still darned cool and amazing...
